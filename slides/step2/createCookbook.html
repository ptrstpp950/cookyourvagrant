<h3>Create cookbook</h3>
<p>To create a new cookbook we need to use knife tool. (BTW: In my opinion it should be "pen" or "kitchen" not "knife"). The command is quite self-explained</p>
<pre><code class="bash">knife cookbook create storm -o ./cookbooks</code></pre>
<p>Usually cookbook have separate folder <u>outside</u> the vagrant directory, but for presentation it is easier to put them in this folder</p>
