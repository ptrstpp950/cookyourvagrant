<h3>Chef - introduction</h3>
<blockquote cite="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chef_(software)">Chef is a configuration management tool written in Ruby and Erlang. It uses a pure-Ruby, domain-specific language (DSL) for writing system configuration "recipes". Chef is used to streamline the task of configuring & maintaining a company's servers, and can integrate with cloud-based platforms such as Rackspace, Amazon EC2, Google Cloud Platform, OpenStack and Microsoft Azure to automatically provision and configure new machines.</blockquote>
