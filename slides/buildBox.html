<h3>Build your own box</h3>
<p>It is easy but time consuming. The basic build is simple</p>
<pre><code class="shell">vagrant package --base [VM name from Virtual Box] --output /myfolder/myboxname.box
</code></pre>

<p>There are some "tools" like packer.io to automatize building your box for example with: <a href="https://github.com/joefitzgerald/packer-windows">https://github.com/joefitzgerald/packer-windows</a>, but it takes hours to build a Windows box (download ISO, install updates, ngen .NET framework, etc.), but it is like: fire and forget :)</p>
