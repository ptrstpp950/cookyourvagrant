<h3>Change Vagrantfile</h3>
<p>Change both IP, we can just add 10 to each IP, so nimbus will have 192.168.33.20, and worker 192.168.33.21<br/>Also we need to add element in both chef provisioning:</p>
<pre><code class="ruby">chef.json = { storm: {host:"192.168.33.20"}, zookeeper: {nodes:"192.168.33.20,192.168.33.21"} }</code></pre>
