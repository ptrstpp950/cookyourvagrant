<h3>Installing storm</h3>
<p>The command to install storm is obvious, but according to documentation
<blockquote cite="https://storm.incubator.apache.org/documentation/Setting-up-a-Storm-cluster.html">The last step is to launch all the Storm daemons. It is critical that you run each of these daemons under supervision. Storm is a fail-fast system which means the processes will halt whenever an unexpected error is encountered</blockquote>
So we need to install some supervisor demon.
