<h3>Installing Zookeeper</h3>
<p>Because we have now everything configured we are ready to install packages. In our Vagrantfile we need to add following lines</p>
<pre><code class="ruby">config.vm.provision :shell, :inline  => '
	sudo yum install -y jdk
	sudo yum install -y zookeeper
	/bin/cp -f /vagrant/zookeeper.initd /etc/init.d/zookeeper
	/etc/init.d/zookeeper start
	/etc/init.d/zookeeper status'</code></pre>
<p>We installed Java (jdk), zookeeper and create service for it (needed file is here TODO_URL). Te last line is just to see in log that service is running :)</p>
