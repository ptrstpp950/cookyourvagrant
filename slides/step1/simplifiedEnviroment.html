<h3>Simplified environment rules</h3>

<p>To simply our work:</p>
<ul>
	<li>every step will be commit to git repository </li>
	<li>all paths should be relative same (if you really don't like it use symbolic links)</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>So let's create folder somewhere on your PC with following command
<pre><code class="bash">mkdir cookVagrant
</code></pre>
