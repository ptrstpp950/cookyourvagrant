<h3>External vs. internal repositories</h3>
<p>External repositories are good but:</p>
<ul>
	<li>You are on developer PC</li>
	<li>You don't need to create a new machine when network connection is down</li>
	<li>You create open source in all continents :)</li>
	<li>You have really FAST Internet connection</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>In real life company life it is much easier to use internal package repository</p>
